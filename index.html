				<h2>LET'S START OUR DAILY LIFE WITH OUR ALMIGHTY FATHER</h2>
				<div class="post">

				</div>
				<p>
					Let us start our day with our Almighty father. Many people, especially in the Philippines, believe
					that God is the creator in the universe and the Earth. He is also creator of us, the humans and the animals.
					For us, their faith provides a sense of purpose and meaning in life. It offers confort during the difficult
					times, like when we're on the hard situation and we asked help to God, and he also gives us protection. Also,
					we believe that God sent his son, Jesus Christ, to Earth to save us from our sins. Through his death and resurrection,
					Jesus provides a way for people to be forgiven and have eternal life. So, we keep praying in God, and remember God is Real.
					Amen?

				<h2>EDUCATION IS IMPORTANT</h2>
				<div class="post">

				</div>
				<p>
					Education is a key and the power in our lives. It helps you develop critical skills like decision-making, mental
					agility, problem-solving, and logical thinking. These skills can be applied in our future jobs and in our lives, like
					when the people face problems in certain situations. We need to go to school, be well, and study hard for the success
					in future. With education, you can read, write, speak, think critically, make decisions, know right and wrong, effectively
					communicate, and understand how these things in the world works. While having lack of education, particularly in poor or
					developing countries, increases the illiterary rate and the number of people of not able to acquire these skills learned
					in school.
				</p>

				<p>
					Students who do well in school are better able to make the transition into adulthood and to achieve occupational and
					economic success.

				<h2>COMPUTERS ALL AROUND US</h2>
				<div class="post">
					<img src="img/computer.png" alt="My Profile Image">
				</div>
				<p>
					We're so fortunate that we have access to computers and other technologies, unlike some countries, particularly in Africa
					where they have no access to technologies. The simple technology, like the personal computer consists of CPU, monitor, 
					mouse, and keyboard that runs together on a three-step cycle, namely input, process, and output. </p>

				<p> Computers give advantages to us, like high speed, conveniency, automation, accuracy, storage, and some ease of access. Now,
				we can do work much easier with the help of the new technologies, like in medicine, scientific research, and political defense.
				We can even also give us entertainment like playing video games, reading e-books, and watching movies and videos.
				</p>

				<p> Computers also have their disadvantages too. They can be slow, unreliable, expensive, and the requirement of constant
				maintenance and upgrades. Hackers could also steal your private data and leak them on the internet, so anyone can access
				this data. There are also threats like viruses, spams, bug and many other problems. It also gives us some health problems
				like too much sitting, the posture, back and neck pains, eye strain, and addiction. </p>

				<p>So, we should use the computer wisely, do what to do and what not to do when using, manage the time well in using these
				type of technologies.</p>

				<h3>Popular Post</h3>
				<div class="postimg"><img src="img/firstpost.png"></div>
				<p>One of my favorite subjects is Mathematics. Although most of the children especially in the United States
				do not like Math, it is important in our real lives like if we are in a job and use it for calculation.</p>

				<h3>Popular Youtube Video</h3>
				<div class="postimg"><img src="img/secondpost.png"></div>
				<p>This video is so far the most viewed in my Youtube Channel. I just compiled 11 episodes from AvM Season 3 
				into a movie. Although I borrowed these clips from the famous Animator - Alan Becker, this is one of the most proud
				achievements I've ever seen, with over 100K views and 50K watch hours. I gained 100 subscribers in the last 28 days.</p>

				<h3>My First Book</h3>
				<div class="postimg"><img src="img/thirdpost.png"></div>
				<p>
					This is so far the first story book I wrote. The title is "Once a Lucid Dreamer". A lucid dream, from the title
					itself, is a type of dream in which the dreamer becomes aware that they are dreaming while dreaming. It is a story all
					about the conflicts between the wonderful dreams and the dreadful reality. The main character in this story is
					Roseanne Angelique, having a dream to fall in love with Owen, but was disturbed by his mom, forcing her to go back to reality.
					The genre is considered as fiction because of this rare skill that Angelique has, like you can even be able to control how the 
					action unfolds, as if you're directing a movie in your sleep. </p>

					<p> If you want to read this full story, then you can go to the Student's Loungue at the BE 5th floor. </p>

				<h3>Describe About Me</h3>
				<p>My favorite hobbies usually are building electronics and robotics. I also love listening to
				music and playing instruments. My developing hobbies are writing stories and essays to the real
				life. I also participated in Mathematics challenges because I'm interested at Math and sometimes
				Science.</p>
